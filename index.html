		<p>Hi, I'm Gembia. I recently saw a lot of nice friend groups being formed online, so I decided to make this page and actually use social media. If you want to talk to me, just go ahead, it's what I made this page for, I'd love to talk to you!<p>
		<p>I'm a 15 year old biological, straight male. I currently have a partner. My birthday is October 26th. I'm also plural (endogenic), and my girlfriend is a headmate of mine. I would consider myself extremely open-minded to most things. I'm in the GMT-6 timezone.</p>

		<h4>Pronouns</h4>

		<br>
		<h4>Interaction Rules</h4>
		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Just be a good person, and do not genuinely wish death upon ANYONE. Do not make "Sayori jokes". I will not talk(joking is okay) about sexual topics with you if you are more than 2 years younger than me (don't care how much older though), and will not interact period if you are ≤13. Also, do not attempt to engage in any form of romance or sexual activity(talking about it is okay) with me.</p>

		<br>
		<h4>Headmates</h4>
		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I only currently have one, but with how low my cognitive "barriers" have been lately, do not be suprised if this number changes. My personal explanation is that they are portions of my "soul" and brain that have been sectioned off enough to develop their own thought proccesses, opinions, and emotions.</p>
		<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">Sayori (Doki Doki Literature Club)<h4>
		<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The aforementioned girlfriend. 15, birthday is September 22nd. Likes writing, most movies, and loves people. Should probably get her to write this segment herself. Rarely communicates with the physical world.<br>Something to note, we make a distinction between specifically THIS Sayori, and every other one, so if you love her (the character/your own headmate) too, I won't get mad at you for trying to "steal" her or something.</p>
